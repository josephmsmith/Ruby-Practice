# Ruby Algorithm Practice
Used a variety of resources to solve algorithms in mostly Ruby but have some others sprinkled in. Each file represents a different resource found and the files inside contain solutions to problems in addition to personal notes, test calls, and more efficient solutions. Feel free to suggest edits or use for personal benefit. I've included some notes below with my thoughts on each platform. Enjoy!
## Resources
- [Excercism](https://github.com/josephmsmith/ruby-alg-practice/tree/main/excercism_lessons)\
Great for those who have taken foundational Ruby courses and have solid fundamentals. This really helps connect Ruby with bigger fundamentals. I took an approach of trying to optimize for a future development environment. Check out their [site](excercism.org).
- [Sololearn](https://github.com/josephmsmith/ruby-alg-practice/tree/main/sololearn_practice)\
Sololearn has an app and Desktop version for their website. It's great for learning fundamentals and baseline knowledge especially if you are new to coding. Check out their [site](sololearn.com) and download the app if you want to play games that test your knowledge in a variety of languages. They have a built in ide for on the go practice.
- [AppsScript](https://github.com/josephmsmith/ruby-alg-practice/tree/main/AppsScript)\
This is a shameless plug to a couple scripts I think are helpful for the every day Google Sheets user. AppsScript is based in JavaScript but they have great [Documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) that should be easy to pick up if your familiar with coding in different languages. It's giving... Automation.
